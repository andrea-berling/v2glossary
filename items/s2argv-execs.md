## s2argv-execs (vÂ²)

It is a library (libexecs) providing a  group  of functions extending the 
exec(3) family provided by the libc.

execs, execse, execsp and execspe are similar to  execv(3),  execve(2),
execvp(3) and execvpe(3), respectively, but they take a command line argument 
string as the file to execute.

s2argv converts a command line string in argv format.

libexecs can be used in embedded systems (it has a very low memory footprint,
		can be used using stack allocationonly) and does not use any shell.
Libexecs provides also a safereplacement for system(3) and tools for
coprocessing.
