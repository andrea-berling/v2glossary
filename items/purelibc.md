## purelibc (vÂ²)

It is a glibc overlay library for process self-virtualization. Purelibc basically converts glibc
from a libc+system interfacing library into a libc-only library. To do that it uses the so called
"LD\_PRELOAD trick": using the LD\_PRELOAD environment variable the user can specify a shared object
that will be loaded before any other, including the C runtine (libc.so). With Purelibc a user can
define a function that will intercept all the system calls and execute user defined code. This way
processes can virtualize their own system calls.

It is used in vuos to implement virtualization efficiently: the additional cost of the
virtualization is that of a function call. This way umvu can have an efficient implementation of
module nesting.

question, which references a discussion on a subreddit called "proggit":
