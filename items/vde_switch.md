## vde\_switch (vÂ²)

It is a component of VDE. It is the virtual counterpart of a physical switch. 
`vde_switch` command creates a
virtual switch. Processes (virtual machines, VUOS instances, VDE namespaces)
can be interconneced by a `vde_switch`.	It
supports many common switch features (like port control, creation of VLANs,
network filtering, etc.). The switch can
be managed through the use of an interactive command line prompt.
