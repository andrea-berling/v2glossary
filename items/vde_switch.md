## vde\_switch (vÂ²)

It's a component of VDE. It's an abstraction for the physical switch. It allows for the creation of
a virtual switch to which processes can connect. It supports many usual switch features (like port
control, creation of VLANs, network filtering, etc.). The switch is created in a user directory and
can be managed through the use of an interactive command line prompt.
