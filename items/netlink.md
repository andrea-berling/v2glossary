## netlink

It's a socket family designed to exchange information between the kernel and
user-space processes.
It permits also to configure the network in a more elegant 
and efficient way (than the previous netdevice(7)). 
It has been created to offer a more
versatile solution for network configuration and to be an alternative to the traditional method of
using ioctl calls.

It is (partly) documented in RFC 3549.
