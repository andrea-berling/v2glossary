## netlink

It's a socket family designed to configure the network in a more elegant fashion. It allows
communication between userspace processes and kernel processes. It has been created to offer a more
versatile solution for network configuration and to be an alternative to the traditional method of
using ioctl calls.

It is (partly) documented in RFC 3549.
