## FUSE

*It is a software interface for Unix-like computer operating systems that lets non-privileged users create their own file systems without editing kernel code. This is achieved by running file system code in user space while the FUSE (Filesystem in Userspace) module provides only a "bridge" to the actual kernel interfaces.* (Wikipedia)
