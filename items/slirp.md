## slirp

It is a program that emulates a PPP, SLIP or CSLIP connection to Internet via a shell account. It
is widely used by virtual machine hypervisors to provide virtual networking services. It can work as
a general purpose TCP/IP emulator. No configuration is required on the guest side and no privileged
services are required on the host side.
