## vde\_plug (vÂ²)

It's a component of VDE. It's an abstraction for the physical network plug.
These can be created and processes using VDE can attach to them. It allows for
the creation of a distributed network.

The network traffic is translated in a simple bidirectional character stream
between two plugs.
